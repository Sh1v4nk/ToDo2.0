## Overview

ToDo2.0 is an enhanced version of my original ToDoList application, rebuilt using ReactJS and Tailwind CSS. This project includes new features such as editable tasks and background color changes when tasks are checked. The interface remains clean and intuitive, making it an excellent project for anyone looking to learn or improve their skills in React and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- **Add and Remove Tasks:** Easily add tasks to your list and remove them when they're completed.
- **Edit Tasks:** Click on a task to edit its content directly in the list.
- **Save Tasks Locally:** Your tasks are saved to local storage, so you won't lose them even if you close the browser.
- **Background Color Change:** When a task is checked as completed, the background color changes to visually indicate its completion.
- **Responsive Design:** The application is responsive and works well on various devices, from desktops to smartphones.

## How to Use

- **Add Tasks:** Type your task in the input field and press enter to add it to the list.
- **Edit Tasks:** Click on a task to edit its content. Press enter to save the changes.
